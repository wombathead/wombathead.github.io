# Research

My research interests are in algorithmic game theory and mechanism design, bounded rationality, and computational complexity.

## DAI Seminar

I help to organise the fortnightly seminar for the DAI research group.
We don't have much of an online presence as it stands so I will make a note of past talks here.
If you'd like to present a talk on your work at the seminar please get in touch!
