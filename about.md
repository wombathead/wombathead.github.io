I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Algorithmic Decision Theory](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~adt/) group at the University of New South Wales where I am working with [Toby Walsh](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/) under the Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship project "Trustworthy AI".
Before this I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at King's College London with a thesis on the topic of bounded rationality in mechanism design under the supervision of [Carmine Ventre][carmine] and [Bart de Keijzer][bart].
I was funded by an [EPSRC DTP studentship][epsrc-dtp].
I completed my undergraduate and masters degrees in computer science at the University of Warwick. 

My CV is [here](/assets/thomas-archbold.pdf) (updated Nov 2024).

I like aviation, space, computer programming, rugby, photography, and playing the guitar.
