I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at King's College London where I am supervised by [Carmine Ventre][carmine] and [Bart de Keijzer][bart]. I am part of the [Distributed Artificial Intelligence][DAI] research group. My main research interests are in algorithmic game theory and mechanism design, topics at the intersection of theoretical computer and economics concerned with designing algorithms whose inputs come from selfish agents with private information. Specifically I am looking at agents with some form of bounded rationality. I am also interested in computational complexity and its intersection with algorithmic game theory. I am funded by an [EPSRC DTP studentship][epsrc-dtp].

Prior to King's I did an undergraduate and master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Warwick. My master's thesis was on decentralised [prediction markets][prediction-markets] and was supervised by Matthias Englert, and my undergraduate dissertation was (trying to make) an educational kernel for the Raspberry Pi and was supervised by Adam Chester.

My CV is [here](/assets/thomas_archbold.pdf) (as of Apr 2022).

I like programming for fun and currently my favourite language is (Common) Lisp. In case you haven't heard of them, take a look at [Advent of Code][advent-of-code] and [Project Euler][project-euler]. You can see some of my attempts at these and some of my other projects on my [Github][my-github]. I have recently got into (film) photography and like to play the guitar (to a questionable standard).
