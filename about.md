I am a firstyear Ph.D. student in Computer Science at King's College London,
where I am part of the [Distributed Artificial Intelligence][DAI] research
group. My research interests are in algorithmic game theory and mechanism
design, complexity theory, and other areas of theoretical computer science. I
am funded by an [EPSRC DTP studentship][epsrc-dtp].

Prior to King's I did a BSc. and an MSc. in Computer Science at the University
of Warwick. My master's thesis was on decentralised [prediction
markets][prediction-markets] and was supervised by Matthias Englert, and my
undergraduate dissertation was (trying to make) an educational kernel for the
Raspberry Pi and was supervised by Adam Chester.

My CV is [here](/assets/thomas_archbold.pdf).

I like programming for fun and currently my favourite language is (Common)
Lisp. If you haven't heard of them, take a look at [Advent of
Code][advent-of-code] and [Project Euler][project-euler]. You can see some of
my attempts at these, as well as some of my projects, on my
[Github][my-github]. I also run, play rugby, and like playing the guitar to a
questionable standard.
