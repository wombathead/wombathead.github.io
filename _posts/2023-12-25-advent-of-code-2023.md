That time of year again, it's time for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/).
Again I will be writing my solutions in Common Lisp and writing about them here.

## Day 1: Trebuchet?!

For the first part you are given a bunch of lines containing letters and numbers.
Each line will always contain at least one digit.
For each line we have to combine the digit that appears first (the leftmost digit) with the digit that appears last (the rightmost digit) into a single number, and then sum all these numbers together over each line.
Not too bad, I used the following simple loop:

```common-lisp
(loop for line in (read-from-file filename)
      for digits = (mapcar #'digit-char-p (remove-if-not #'digit-char-p (coerce line 'list)))
      for ldigit = (first digits) and rdigit = (first (last digits))
      sum (+ (* 10 ldigit) rdigit)))
```

Now for the second part it turns out that each line contains _descriptions_ of digits, where this description can either be the digit itself or the word, i.e., "one", "two", "three", etc.
Again we have to combine the leftmost digit with the rightmost in each line and sum these together.
I defined an association list mapping strings to numerical values, so for example `values["six"] == values["6"] == 6`, and then for each line I checked if each digit description ("one", "1", "two", "2", "three", "3", ...) appeared in the line.
Something that caught me out was that `(search digit-description line)` only return the index of the _first_ match in the line, meaning descriptions that appeared multiple times in the same line were being ignored, which was important to find the rightmost description in the line.
I fixed this by simply searching, for each line, the original line for the earliest description of a digit to obtain the leftmost digit, and then _reversing the line_ and searching for the _reversal_ of each number description to obtain the rightmost digit.
Here is the code.
It uses `search-leftmost-description` to find the leftmost digit description, and `search-rightmost-description` is implemented by simply reversing the `line` and `descriptions` parameters and calling `search-leftmost-description`.
We are then left with a string description for a number, which we convert to a number using the helper function `description->digit`, which simply uses the association list (dictionary) to convert a string description to a number.

```common-lisp
(let ((descriptions '("one" "two" "three" "four" "five" "six" "seven" "eight" "nine" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8" "9")))
  (loop for line in (read-from-file filename)
        for ldigit = (description->digit (search-leftmost-description line descriptions))
        for rdigit = (description->digit (reverse (search-rightmost-description line descriptions)))
        for number = (+ (* 10 ldigit) rdigit)
        sum number)))
```
